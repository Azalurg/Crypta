# Crypta

Crypta is a simple yet powerful tool that can be used to help you with offline encryption and decryption. 
It is designed to provide you with a secure and convenient way to encrypt your sensitive data, without having to rely on internet connectivity or third-party services.

## How it Works

Crypta uses a Python script to generate a random key and a one-time use phrase, based on a user-provided seed. The project also includes some PDF files to make coding easier on paper.
To use Crypta safely, you should be on an offline machine, preferably a flash drive system with no storage. You should change the primes in `variables.json` and use a random seed to ensure the maximum level of security.
After encrypting your message on paper, it is safe to store the encrypted message on your computer or in a cloud drive.

## Remainder!

Please note that you should remember the seed and use the same primes each time to keep the encryption and decryption results unchanged.
If you forget the seed, you will not be able to decrypt your message. If you use different primes, you will not be able to decrypt your message.
Your results may vary if you use different versions of my algorithm (the version is on top of each .py file). 
`I will not be responsible for any loss of data. This project is just to help and educate people about cryptography. Do your own research before using this project.`

## Getting Started

To get started with Crypta, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the Crypta project files to your offline machine.
2. Open the `variables.json` file and change the primes to your desired values. Make sure to use a random seed to ensure maximum security.
3. Run the `main.py` script to generate a random key and one-time use phrase.
4. Use the key and phrase to encrypt your sensitive data.
5. To decrypt your data, simply use the same key and phrase in reverse.
